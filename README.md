Here are some tips on making the Samosas:

Most important thing to remember is to not the fry the samosa on high heat, they will not get crispy if you do so and the dough will remain uncooked. The samosa will also have bubbles on the crust if you oil temperature is hot while frying the samosa.
I have used green peas in my samosa filling. If you are not a fan, simply skip.
This recipes makes 14 mediuam sized samosa. You can make more or less depending on how you like.
